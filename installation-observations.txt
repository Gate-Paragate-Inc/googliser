* common for all macOS versions
	- when first run (without brew, etc...) should suggest '--install' instead of brew.
	- xcode was installed automatically by brew - didn't need to request 'xcode-select'.
	- completion didn't work immediately after first install, but worked fine after logout then back in again. Seems tilde isn't accepted as $HOME. Maybe use $HOME instead?
	- script should be moved to permanent location instead of symlinked.
	- blue ANSI text is converted to magenta.
	- 'less' display output in terminal is buggy - duplicates bottom row when scrolled up/down & extended help is missing blank line before "* Optional *".
	- mapfile & readarray are not available (bash 3.2.57)
		maybe use this instead? (https://stackoverflow.com/a/23843116/6182835):
			while IFS=\= read var value; do
				vars+=($var)
				values+=($value)
			done < VarsValues.txt

* 10.13 High Sierra (darwin17)
	- usage example of script name in basic help is almost unreadable due to low contrast (white terminal background).
	- usage example in extended help is unreadable due to low contrast (white terminal background).

* 10.14 Mojave (darwin18) using dark desktop theme

* 10.15 Catalina (darwin19.0) using dark desktop theme
	- "zsh: command not found: complete"

* Ubuntu 19.10 Desktop x64
	- when '--install'ing, first prompt is for sudo password, but there's no message on screen to say why this is needed.
	- if user elects to abort install within local package manager, we should not continue the googliser installation process (creating completion script, etc...).
